  <td>Robus support.
    In react, as everywhere else, IDE support and autocompletion is enhanced by typescript, making it safer and easier.
    Easeur to make, maintain and reuse components.
    Props in typescript are prettier and more easy to read.</td>

<p>NOTE: You can aim for strict typescript while still having strict to false. Using strict typescript here would take months to rewrite, and a very long time to get to while passively aiming for it. But that does not mean you should not aim for it.</p>
