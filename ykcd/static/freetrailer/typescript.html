            Though anonymous types and objects are allowed, as long as the
            compiler can derive what types the variables are, it is not wise to
            use when an object or type it used outside of that explicit context.

            Robus support. In react, as everywhere else, IDE support and

            easier. Easeur to make, maintain and reuse components. Props in
            typescript are prettier and more easy to read.
